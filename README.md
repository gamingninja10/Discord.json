## Discord.json
##### The easiest way to make a discord bot.

---

### What is Discord.json?

Discord.json is a Discord bot that loads commands and data from json files lowering the barrier of entry for making simple Discord bots.

### Why should I use this?

If you're already a developer you probably shouldn't, however, If you don't know how to program and just want a basic bot for your server this is probably the right program for you because of it's simplicity.

### Why does this exist?

While I wish I could tell you a story amazing story about why I decided to do this, the real reason is, I was just wanted to make something and didn't have much else to do in my free time ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

### How do I use it?

Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/gamingninja10/discord-json/wiki)

### How can I report a bug or suggest a feature?

Create a new [issue](https://github.com/gamingninja10/discord-json/issues) and select either 'Bug report' or 'Feature Request'

### Your code is bad.

Yeah yeah, I know, I chose this project over others because I wanted to learn how to do stuff like this, If you want to make a pull request or fork the project feel free!
